# Gazola Machine Learning REST API
This RESTful Web service provides endpoints to access a Machine Learning model
trained to predict apartment's prices in SÃ£o Paulo city, based on some features
like total area.

The model was trained using Gazola's dataset that can be accessed [here](),
and this is an academic project as part of my post graduation course in
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Along with the prediction endpoint it's also available a specific endpoint for
the model documentation and a Swagger/OpenAPI interface as well.

The system is deployed using Docker to make it self-contained and allow
scalability across multiple environments.

This is currently a **work in progress**.

## Running
To build and run the application, clone the repository and run in a terminal
from the same directory where the ```docker-compose-{environment}.yaml``` file
is, where *environment* can be *dev*, *test*, *prod* or whatever:

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up
```

To stop the application, run from the same directory:

```
$ docker-compose stop
```

## Testing
The specific ```docker-compose-test.yaml``` file was made to run unit tests with
*PyTest* and generate both test and coverage reports inside the *tests* directory:

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yaml up
```

This should start the container, run the tests, generate the reports and exit.

## Accessing
After build and run it's possible to explore the API by using the Swagger/OpenAPI
Web interface at [http://localhost:8000/v1/ui/](http://localhost:8000/v1/ui/).

## Structure
Here is how the project is structured:

* **/controllers**: Responsible for handling HTTP request and response
* **/ml**: Where the machine learning models resides to be accessed by the controllers, we can think as our business layer
* **/resources**: Configuration and stand-alone scripts for tooling
* **/tests**: Unit and system tests, coverage and test reports
* **application.py**: Application setup and starting point
